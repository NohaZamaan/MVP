### Introduction:

Industries of malware and hacking are very powerful and growth sharply. It works to harm millions of victims and companies. These industries have great funding from a variety of organizations and people to meet their purposes. However, large global companies like Microsoft work hard to defense their customer from any attack.
Microsoft provides its dataset ‘ https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction’ that includes many features about its consumer’s machine devices that collected by by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution and Windows Defender.<p> 
<B> Microsoft </B> challenges the data scientist to apply various machine learning models to predict malware before occurring.

|SkuEdition | The goal of this feature is to use the Product Type defined in the MSDN to map to a 'SKU-Edition' name that is useful in population reporting. The valid Product Type are defined in %sdxroot%\data\windowseditions.xml. This API has been used since Vista and Server 2008, so there are many Product Types that do not apply to Windows 10. The 'SKU-Edition' is a string value that is in one of three classes of results. The design must hand each class.|

### Data Preprocessing 
   
The dataset was very big , it contains 8921482 rows, so,I decided to cut it in 10000 rows.<p>
There were 10 columns that had unavailable data or were null, so, I dropped them all.<p>
Identifier features are type float but actually their number refers to ID of device or other, so I used 'count_values' then categorical to 1 refer to 'most_frequency' ,2->'Second_frequency' 3->'third_frequency', 4->'forth_frequency' and the rest values-> 5.<p>
Other features that had some missing values, presented to see the type of them.<p>
All missing values were in numorical columns, then Visualized to see their
distribution.<p>
![distribution](https://github.com/NohaZamaan/Project_T5/blob/main/Images/Screen%20Shot%201443-04-10%20at%2010.29.05%20PM.png) 
Most columns have an unnormal distribution, so, using 'median' to fill in the missing value is best.<p>
Using 'get_dummy' function to convert all categorical columns<p>
Then apply heatmap to approve no missing value in the data and print the new shape of the data<p>

### Methodology <p>
#### - Dealing with Features <p>
After using dummy, there are 12347 columns. It is unpossible to use all these features for modeling 
<p> So, I tried to use different techniques<p>
- Select the best 10 features by:<p>
   1)feature_importances_ from ExtraTreesClassifier: <p>
      
   ![feature_importances_](https://github.com/NohaZamaan/Project_T5/blob/main/Images/Screen%20Shot%201443-04-11%20at%2010.10.28%20PM.png) <p>
      
   2)SelectKBest from chi2:<p>
      
   ![SelectKBest](https://github.com/NohaZamaan/Project_T5/blob/main/Images/Screen%20Shot%201443-04-11%20at%2010.10.48%20PM.png) <p>
      
   3)feature_importances_ from RandomForestRegressor: <p>
      
   ![rf_feature_importances_](https://github.com/NohaZamaan/Project_T5/blob/main/Images/Screen%20Shot%201443-04-11%20at%2010.11.01%20PM.png) <p>
      
- Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with n_components=6 <p>
   
   
#### - Modeling
   
the dataset divided into a training set (90%) and a testing set (10%) in all models.<p>

   - Logistic Regression Model with Pipline, Scaling, GridSearch <p>
   
| Method_Name | Train_Score | Test_Score |
| :---:   | :-: | :-: |
| ExtraTreesClassifier  | 0.581 | 0.593 |
| SelectKBest |0.584 |0.599|
|Random Forest Feature Importances |0.581 | 0.594| 

<p> I select the best two score to apply the next model on them <p>
   
   - KNeighborsClassifier Model with Pipline, Scaling, GridSearch <p>
   
| Method_Name | Train_Score | Test_Score |
| :---:   | :-: | :-: |
| SelectKBest |0.558  |0.556|
|Random Forest Feature Importances |0.637 | 0.571|
   
   - Random Forest Classifier Model with Pipline, Scaling, GridSearch <p>  
 
| Method_Name | Train_Score | Test_Score |
| :---:   | :-: | :-: |
| SelectKBest |0.59  |0.607|
|Random Forest Feature Importances |0.601 | 0.597|
| PCA  | 0.666| 0.54 |
      
   - Neural_Network Model <p>
      

| Method_Name | Train_roc_auc_score| Test_roc_auc_score |
| :---:   | :-: | :-: |
| SelectKBest | 0.590 |0.597|
      
<p>
      
### Results and Conclusion 
      
👁  Random Forest was the best model performance with Scaling and GridSearch methods :+1: . However, it consumed the longest time in execution. 
      
👁  The  scores of ‘SelectKBest()’ and 'Feature_Importances_' functions very close to each other when applying models on them, so, may recommend to use them on huge features. <p>
   
| Model_Name | Feature Method | Train_Score | Test_Score | Roc_Auc_score |
| :---:      | :--:            | :--:        | :--:        | :--:      |
| Random Forest Classifier | SelectKBest | 0.59  | 0.607 | 62.23 |
   
   <p>
      
 
👁 Still, the score isn’t good even though trying a variety of parameters. GridSearch, and scaling the data.
      
👁 All models give nearly the same range of scores

👁 Random Forest classifier model was the best model among the other three.

👁 The score still not very good, maybe need to use other techniques to improve working models, using another model or using other features.

👁 Some time the test score was better than the train score a little bit; this result makes me confident that no overfitting in the model. Also, because the change is small, so, I am not worried about that, my model is under fitting.

👁 This result leads us to agree that, some problems are still hard to predict their solution for them even though they have data about them. :shipit: <p>
